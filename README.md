The Canteen Ordering Website is a full-stack web application designed to simplify food ordering for students and faculty while giving complete control to the canteen vendor. Built using React.js, Tailwind CSS, GSAP animations, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, the platform ensures a smooth and efficient user experience while optimizing canteen operations.

The platform enables users to browse the menu, place orders online, and make secure digital payments, reducing long queues and manual order processing. Vendors get a dedicated dashboard to manage orders, update menus, track payments, and monitor business insights in real time.

The frontend is developed with React.js and Tailwind CSS for a fully responsive design, while GSAP animations enhance the UI. WebSocket integration ensures instant order updates. On the backend, Node.js and Express.js handle authentication, order processing, and database management, with MongoDB securely storing user details, orders, and payments.

A key feature is the vendor dashboard, providing full control over operations. Vendors can view and update orders, modify menu items, and track sales easily.

For secure transactions, the platform integrates Razorpay, allowing payments through UPI, credit/debit cards, and net banking. Payment logs are maintained for vendors to verify transactions. JWT authentication ensures secure login for both users and vendors, with role-based access providing separate dashboards.

This project aims to reduce waiting times, improve order management, and bring digital convenience to canteen services. By offering a fast, efficient, and secure system, it benefits both users and vendors, making food ordering hassle-free. ðŸš€
